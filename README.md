Random Factorio Things (RFT for short) extends vanilla (base) game, adding new assembling machines, new buildings tiers and new modules.

### Main features:

- New tiers of common machines, such as furnaces or mining drills.
- New "Nuclear" tier for assemblling machines, inserters and transport belts.
- Level 4-6 modules.
- Merged modules up to 4 levels. Merged modules combine characteristics of two modules, but take only one module slot.
- Ability to combine wood and coal to get more effective fuel. ~~By the way, not really a main feature.~~
